                   <strong>Unmanned Rescue Mission (URM) </strong>is the biggest event of &lsquo;ESONANCE 2015&rsquo; featuring a<br>
robotic competition on &ldquo;Rescue Operation during natural Disaster&rdquo;. Here, participants<br>
have to solve a scaled down version of a problem arena depicting disaster situation with<br>
exclusive obstacles and difficulties.<br>
Delivering aid, including food, clean water, fuel and medical supplies to places during<br>
natural disaster such as Earthquake, becomes a difficult task.<br>
Transporting bulk materials over uneven and rough terrain, in tight spaces, and over long<br>
distances is often required to help those in need.<br>
While several frequent tremors were already felt in different regions of Bangladesh, the<br>
country is far from being completely safe from massive Earthquake threats.<br>
Keeping these situations in mind and its possible after effects, this year&rsquo;s challenge is to<br>
design and develop a scaled-down version of a transporter capable of delivering<br>
aid/materials, which will be guided by, at most, one person.<br>
The contestants need to design <strong>two </strong>robots in this competition: an <strong>autonomous line</strong><br>
<strong>follower </strong>and a <strong>transporter</strong>. Each robot will be assigned to perform separate task in<br>
separate arena (line follower arena and Transporter arena).<br>
1. <strong>Autonomous line follower: </strong>A small <strong>autonomous robot </strong>has to follow a line in<br>
line follower arena under various conditions (e.g. round corners, sharp<br>
corners, crossovers, line obstacles etc.). This line follower robot will be used to<br>
unlock different aids/supports to resolve exclusive obstacles (e.g. bridge,<br>
road block, short cut etc.) for smooth travel of the <strong>transporter </strong>in transporter<br>
arena.<br>
2. <strong>Transporter: </strong>A manually controlled, robot which will be capable of<br>
transporting objects of different shapes and sizes to the final unloading zone<br>
in the transporter arena.<br>
<strong>The manual bot should be wirelessly controlled.</strong><br>
<strong>As for example</strong>, in line follower arena, the autonomous line follower robot crosses some<br>
  obstacles by following a line and finishes predefined checkpoints (tasks). The successful<br>
  completion of those tasks will allow the team to establish a bridge in transporter arena<br>
  for the manually controlled robot (transporter) to cross a zone filled with water.<br>
  Any team failing to perform the tasks to trigger the bridge by the autonomous robot will<br>
  not be able to perform the other task that will involve the manual robot.<br>
  There are 3 stages, each of an increasing level of complexity.<br>
  <strong>– Qualifying Stage</strong><br>
  <strong>– Knock out Stage</strong><br>
  <strong>– Final Stage</strong><br>
  &bull; Top 10 teams in qualifying stage will be eligible for Knock out stage.*<br>
  &bull; Top 5 teams in Knock out stage will be eligible for Final stage.*<br>
  &bull; Top 3 teams will be selected as Champion, 1st runners up, 2nd runners up.<br>
   The competition is open to all the students of school, college and undergraduate<br>
  students of all universities.<br>
   The participant team must register on the website of the competition.<br>
  *<em>No. of eligible team in this stage will be decided on the competition day based on the number</em><br>
  <em>of participant team.</em><br>

					 Competition arena will be made of a flat wood platform, with a maximum size<br>
approximately 850cm x 300cm.<br>
&bull; The arena consists of a black semi-gloss painted road (track) of 30 cm wide, with<br>
a centered white line of 2.5±0.2 cm wide.<br>
&bull; The starting and finishing Zone will be defined separately by 30 cm × 30 cm white<br>
colored square area in the arena.<br>
&bull; There will be check marks at different position of the track.<br>
&bull; There will be a Gap on the track for 15±5 cm, and may be placed in a curve or<br>
straight portion of the track.<br>
&bull; There will be &ldquo;T&rdquo;, &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and &ldquo;+&rdquo; shape intersections.<br>
&bull; The track will have arcs with different curvatures. Minimal curve diameter will be<br>
10 cm.<br>
&bull; Sharp angles may occur, but will not be less than 30°.<br>
&bull; Different obstacles with the discontinuity of the line (maximum dimension of the<br>
obstacle is approximately 20 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm; L x W x H) will be placed on the<br>
track. The robot has to drive around these obstacles to reach the continuation of<br>
the line.<br>
&bull; The number of obstacles will be no more than 4.<br>
&bull; The track will contain shortcuts that might or might not contain obstacles of the<br>
above mentioned dimensions.<br>
&bull; Bridge/hill will be placed on the track. The length will be at least 40cm. Height will<br>
be at most 15cm above the ground and the inclined angle will be maximum 300.<br>
The black line will be continue on the hill/bridge.<br>
&bull; Position of check points, gaps, obstacles and hill/bridge may be anywhere on the<br>
track.<br>
&bull; Lighting levels are unpredictable, so the robot must be able to operate over a<br>
wide range of lighting conditions.<br>
&bull; There will be a final checkpoint on crossing which the bridge for the 2nd task will be<br>
established automatically.<br>
&bull; Keeping the basic specifications of arena fixed, there will be modifications in<br>
arena for 3 stages with increasing difficulties.

				 The competition arena for the 2nd task is made out of flat wood platform, with a<br>
maximum size of approximately 850cm X 60cm.<br>
&bull; There are two ramps on either side of the arena of angle 30±5 degree.<br>
&bull; The starting and the unloading zones will be marked by 50cm X 60cm mark as<br>
&ldquo;Starting&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unloading Zones&rdquo;.<br>
&bull; The arena will be divided in different zones. Each zone has fixed width of 60cm but<br>
varied length. Each zone has 1.5±0.2 cm height variation with respect to its adjacent<br>
zones.<br>
&bull; The arena will have a zone defined by 40cm X 60cm filled with water, over which a<br>
bridge of 35cm wide will be established after the autonomous robot completes its<br>
task.<br>
&bull; The arena will have a zone defined by 90cm X 60cm which will consist of small stones<br>
and gravels, however the height of this zone will not be uniform. Height will be varied<br>
in between 8cm to 10cm. The manual robot needs to cross this zone without the aid<br>
of any bridges.<br>
&bull; The manual robot needs to pick up objects of dimension 4cm x 4cm x 4cm<strong>, </strong>weight<br>
100±50 gm. which might be placed at any position along the track.<br>
&bull; Maximum number of objects may be 4.<br>
&bull; Objects will be placed anywhere in the arena. The manual robot should pick up the<br>
objects simultaneously and unload them simultaneously at the unloading zone.<br>
&bull; Object unloaded outside the vicinity of the unloading zone will not be counted.<br>

mentioned in “Robot Specification”.
&bull; Any of the robots not satisfying the tests of ratification will be excluded from
the competition.

&bull; The manual robot should make a onetime run and proceed to the<br>
unloading zone. It picks up each object on the way and unloads them at<br>
the unloading zone.<br>
&bull; Time is measured from crossing the start line by the autonomous line follower<br>
until the manual transporter robot unloads the last object. A robot is<br>
considered to have crossed the line when the forward most part of the<br>
robot contacts or crosses over the line.<br>

stopwatch, based on the availability of equipment. In either case the<br>
recorded time will be final.<br>

human intervention.<br>

  &bull; The start and the unloading zone can be on either side of the arena, and<br>
  would be revealed on the day of the competition.<br>
  &bull; In competition, only 5 attempts or restarts of the autonomous robot are<br>
  authorized.<br>
  &bull; If the autonomous robot loses the line, it must restart from the last<br>

  &bull; In competition, only 3 attempts or restarts of the manual robot are allowed.<br>
  In this case, the timer will remain running and a penalty will be pointed.<br>
  &bull; After crossing the bridge, no restart is allowed for manual robot.<br>
